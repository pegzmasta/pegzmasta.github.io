  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  It's not always possible to go to the base library to borrow a book, and
  there's always a chance that they might only have a limited number of
  copies per book, or maybe even none at all.

  In light of all this, we will be using digital copies whenever we can.
  In order to ensure that everyone can access and read these copies: The
  files will only be distributed if it is written in a [[https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/opendocument/reject][free and/or
  universally implemented format (e.g. OpenDocument format, PDF, etc)]]

*** Let's Read-- What does freedom have to do with reading?
  {{{img-url(http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/statementspols/freedomreadstatement,The Right to Read,The Right to Read,http://www.girlslife.com/image.axd?i=37078,)}}} \\
  While there are [[https://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2011/spring/the-danger-of-ebooks][several reasons to reject nonfree eBook formats]]...
  [[http://www.defectivebydesign.org/kindle-fire][several]], the main reason is to promote accessibility between all users,
  and to encourage [[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html][the Right to Read]].

  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  When I first started researching about the /Marine Corps Professional
  Reading Program/, my first step was to read about the official guidance--
  =ALMAR 001/13=.  It seemed like a solid plan; however, it's current
  execution is flawed!  Most purveyors of eBooks utilize nonfree
  technology, nonfree formats, and maintain restrictions on accessing
  books.  Most authors, unfortunately, also distribute books using nonfree
  licensing which contain restrictions on the use of books, and prevents
  sharing.  The execution of the /Marine Corps Professional Reading
  Program/ is not flawed due to any fault of Marines; it is flawed, because
  we rely on defective technologies (i.e. Nonfree Software; nonfree
  formats; malicious technical measures; more about this later) and
  restrictive policies (i.e. nonfree licensing; price barriers and/or
  access barriers; etc .) which we are not always in a position to fix.

  These aforementioned obstacles do *NOT* promote reading-- they hinder it!
  The first step in solving this problem is to recognize its existence.
  Once we've acknowledged that, we can begin to circumvent these obstacles
  and start supporting ethical authors, purveyors, organizations,
  technologies, and distribution websites.  Once everyone has recognized
  this problem, only then can it be solved and circumvention will no
  longer be required.

*** Let's Read-- Encryption is for private messages, not public ones!
    {{{img-url(http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17195,A Message to Garcia,A Message to Garcia,http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/17195/pg17195.cover.medium.jpg,20%)}}} \\

    If defective digital technologies did not exist, then /anyone/ would be
    able to read /A Message to Garcia/.  Does it make sense to add a
    /Technological Protection Measure/ to books that are in the *Public
    Domain*?  How can we spread a message, when specific technologies
    scramble the text in the message (i.e. Encryption), and then encodes
    said messages into secret formats?

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    I will explain the consequences of accepting defective technologies and
    restrictive licensing or policies below, and why we should reject them on
    principle.  An example of a freely[fn:1] licensed eBook from the
    /Commandant's Professional Reading List/, which is encoded in a free
    format (the Kindle version is *NOT* a free format-- _avoid it_; I'll
    explain in more detail below), is located at
    http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17195.  Such a book can be freely read,
    copied, and shared without any legal consequences-- provided that the
    user reads and abides by the license.  Official Marine Corps guidance on
    the professional reading program is also provided, as well as resources
    for Marines if they wish to continue their reading or education online.

*** Let's Read-- Professionals read to learn more about their professions

  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  As you can see, reading can be fun!  More importantly, eBooks can be
  educational, and can present new ideas and concepts that can inspire
  critical thinking, while fine-tuning your awareness of ethics-- which
  plays an important role in what choices you make!  This is exactly what
  I've set out to do in this eBook, and I welcome your feedback.

  A guide is provided for future authors who are willing to contribute
  books that can be freely used and distributed, so that we can have
  control of the knowledge without the interference of a proprietor.

    Marines must continue to read, and to study more about their
    professions.

    A personal reading program is considered to be one of the most
    invaluable resources for defining a Marines commitment to
    intellectual growth, which is beneficial to the Marine Corps;
    selections of books are not limited to just the /Marine Corps
    Professional Reading Program/.  What's important is that Marines
    concentrate on subjects that improve their leadership and warfighting
    abilities-- *Part V* and *Part VI* of this eBook seeks to provide
    resources to aid Marines in finding eBooks, and studying
    military-related topics.

* What principles do I propose for supporting an ethical reading program?
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  According to `Section 6' of =ALMAR 001/13=, the Marine Corps is putting
  forth maximum effort towards obtaining print, electronic, and audio
  formats for each book.  This was written over 2 years ago, and acquiring
  books is still a difficult process!  I propose an ethical execution of
  this plan, in order to ensure that it succeeds for *MAG-49* and
  everywhere else.  In order to do this, we need authors to start writing
  books in a more ethical way.  Below, I attempt to detail the life-cycle
  of creating a book in an ethical manner; from the methods we choose to
  create a book; from the licenses we choose to release it under; from how
  it should be encoded once we finish writing the book; and finally, from
  how it should be released so that anyone can access it.  This very eBook
  is written in the spirit of [[http://wikieducator.org/Libre/Knowledge][libre knowledge]], and is an example of a
  *free* eBook.
  #+END_NOTES
  + I propose that four basic principles should be followed; hopefully,
    all authors, purveyors, vendors, and libraries will follow suit-- they
    should be applied to eBooks and printed books alike:

    computer without software that would trample your freedom.
    #+END_QUOTE
    =-- Free Software Foundation=

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    This particular principle is merely a recommendation-- not a
    requisite.  The author may choose to write their book using whatever
    technology they deem suitable for the task; likewise, the user may
    also choose to read a book using whatever technology they deem
    suitable for the task.  This principle is listed here, because after
    listing the defects of Nonfree Software and formats in *Part IV* of
    this eBook: It only makes sense to also include a solution that is
    devoid of such defects.  While there exists a plethora of reasons for
    using and supporting [[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html][free/libre software]], I will only focus on three
    reasons why *Free Software* should be used for creating an eBook.
    Here is a [[http://directory.fsf.org/wiki?fulltext=Search&profile=default&title=Special%3ASearch&search=books][listing of Free Software]] that can handle opening, editing,
    managing, creating, publishing, and collecting eBooks.
    1. *Control* \\
       Only *Free Software* gives users the [[https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html][freedom to control their
       programs]].  *Free Software* gives users the legal rights necessary
       for controlling their software; in other words, a free/libre
       program provides users the [[http://fsfe.org/activities/ftf/faq-what-is-licensing.en.html][permissions (via a free license)]] and the
       means (via the [[http://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/sourcecode.en.html][source code]] and documentation) necessary for making
       their programs operate the way that they wish.  An author using a
       free/libre program will have full control of the writing process,
       and can even verify that the program is indeed following their
       commands by inspecting the source code of a program.  There exists
       eBooks which are [[https://livinglibre1.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/sharethisbook_finished.pdf][freely licensed to allow modification and
       sharing]]; however, without the source code... _you can't modify
       it!_ \\
        The source code represents the preferred version of a program
       required for making changes to it.  This very eBook comes with
       source code that can also be used as a Transparent copy of this
       eBook for modification purposes; they include
       =the-principles-of-an-ethical-reading-program.org= (the
       corresponding source code of this eBook) and
       =the-principles-of-an-ethical-reading-program.html= (the actual
       source code of this eBook).  Knowing the freedoms that comes with
       *Free Software*, an author is also more likely to license their
       eBooks to have the same kinds of freedom, so that users can freely
       use and distribute their work.
    2. *Accessibility* \\
       The second reason why an author should write their books using
       *Free Software* is to promote accessibility.  A free/libre program
       encodes its data to a free/libre format _by default_.  This is
       important, because certain programs may not save a file in a way
       that is accessible to all users.  Certain programs may even install
       user-scripts into their format, and sometimes even malware!  The
       user-scripts are harmless if they're under your control, but that
       may not always be the case.  Malware, on the other hand, is usually
       under the control of a proprietor who wishes to abuse and take
       advantage of users.  It may seem far-fetched to commit such a
       malpractice, but I can assure you that it does happen-- *Part IV*
       of this eBook will detail these type of attacks on your freedom.
    3. *Cooperation* \\
       The third reason why an author should write their books using
       *Free Software* is to promote cooperation.  If the author is
       writing a fictional work, an art related piece, or maybe even
       an entertaining script or poetry, then there is really no need
       for them to provide the source code for their eBook.  If the
       author is writing a more functional work, an instructional manual,
       or some sort of reference book or educational work, then they may
       want to release the source code for their work in order to gather
       participation in the development of the eBook.  Authors that use
       *Free Software*, are more likely to release the source code for
       their eBooks (I will henceforth be referring to the source code
       of documents by another term, /Transparent copy/, in order to be
       clearer). \\
        Why do I say this?  With *Free Software*, it is considered normal
       for users to have access to the source code of their programs, so
       that they can control it.  [[https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html][Free Software also needs Free
       Documentation]], because we want users to learn *how* to control
       their software.  Whenever we improve our software we also want to
       update our documentation to reflect the changes.  If we create
       version 3 of a program with twice as many features as version 2,
       then it makes sense to also release another version of said
       documentation; otherwise, the user won't know how to use all the
       new features provided in the program. \\
        /Free Documentation/ isn't just for software, though.  It can be
       used for any type of reference or technical work.  If we
       distribute works using licenses that do not permit this type of
       cooperation, then whenever we need to update a work of knowledge

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    In order to promote the right to read an eBook or printed book, and
    share it if we like it: All versions of a book should have a license
    that makes it legal to do so; thus, authors should apply a [[http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses][free/libre
    license]] to their book.  The take-away: _A *Free/Libre License* respects
    the users freedom and community._ \\

    These are *free* as in freedom licenses, which has nothing to do
    with price!  An author may choose to distribute his/her work as
    gratis (i.e. it costs nothing), or at a price; they may even choose
    to distribute gratis digital copies and priced physical copies, and
    vice versa.  The key, is that an author or publisher shouldn't be in
    control of what someone does with his/her work once a copy has been
    acquired, because if they do: The user is *NOT* free to read and
    share the work.  We don't want our eBooks to turn into
    /walled-gardens/; otherwise, we can't control how we use these books.
    No one can control the content or media inside of a /walled-garden/,
    but they do have control of the content or media inside of a *freely*
    licensed book.  This is why I'm pushing for authors to apply a free
    license to their eBooks: If they can do this, then the rest of these
    principles can be applied as well; finally, the user won't be
    subjugated in their use of an eBook (a flaw that even [[https://stallman.org/articles/online-education.html][affects

      which constrain and manipulate us at enormous cost. \\

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    In order to promote interoperability between all devices and
    operating systems: We must insist that eBooks are encoded in a
    [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_file_format][free/libre file format]].  Nonfree formats are not recommended for
    sharing, because they are undocumented; incompatible with [[http://documentfreedom.org/openstandards.en.html][Open
    Standards]]; requires the use of [[https://gnu.org/philosophy/proprietary.html][Nonfree Software]]; and some,
    unfortunately, are infected with malware.  When a document is saved
    in a format that is documented; conforms to /Open Standards/; is
    accessible with /Free Software/; and finally, can be revised
    straightforwardly in a text editor: That file is considered to be a
    Transparent copy, because it can be clearly seen and modified easily.
    With programs, we need the source code to modify them; with
    documents, we need a Transparent copy to modify them. \\

    With a Transparent copy of an eBook, such  as a =.txt=, =.html=,
    or =.tex= file, the user can read the book using an ordinary text
    editor; not only that, but they can update the knowledge-- fixing
    any typos in grammar, spelling, and diction; maybe there are
    hyperlinks that are no longer functional anymore which need to be
    replaced; maybe the concepts inside the eBook have advanced in
    today's current society, to the point where the eBook is no longer
    accurate anymore.  Wouldn't these factors warrant a new version of
    the eBook to be released?  What if the author is not able to make
    these changes?  How else can we release a modified version of the
    eBook?  With *Free Software*, not only do users have *individual
    control*, but they also have the means to exercise *collective
    control* as well.  With /Free Documentation/, the same can be said!
    As long as a freely licensed Transparent copy of the eBook exists,
    *anyone* can edit the eBook and release their own modified version--
    _without the authors permission_ (they still have to respect the
    license; we don't want to modify invariant sections, for this would
    alter and misrepresent an author's point-of-view). \\

    Instead of sharing secret, proprietary, media files... we will only
    share files whose formats are documented, and can be read just as
    easily as a book can be.  Just like this very eBook adheres to a
    documented and Open Standard, other eBooks should also be the same.
    An eBook in a free format provides users the same freedoms that they
    would normally have when reading a printed book.

    *Free/Libre Access* \\

    - What rules would best ensure the maximum dissemination of scientific
      articles, and knowledge, on the web? ... The US Constitution says
      that copyright exists “to promote the Progress of Science”.  When
      copyright impedes the progress of science, science must push
      copyright out of the way.

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    If a digital copy can only be accessed by identifying yourself
    through an authentication system, then that system itself is nonfree
    for it has control over who accesses the book-- this goes against
    the concept of [[https://stallman.org/articles/free-scientific-publishing.html][Free/Libre Access]] and *anonymity*.  The idea of
    identifying yourself makes sense for borrowing a physical copy of a
    book, because the library will now know who to contact if they don't
    return it.  It does *NOT* make sense for digital copies, because of
    the mere fact that it is impossible to /borrow/ something as
    /intangible/ as digital information (i.e. one can not /physically/
    take something that has no /physical/ form); on the contrary, it is
    possible to copy digital information.  I can see it now as a
    librarian asks, "=Good afternoon, Marine!  Our records indicate that
    you borrowed a set of ones and zeroes the other day (i.e. an=
    =eBook), and it appears that the data is now overdue.  Could you
    please return the information to us, so that other users can read=
    =the numbers?=" This malpractice is similar to /eBook lending/
    (I'll explain later). \\

    If the principles of *Free/Libre Access* were applied, the librarian
    would never ask such a silly question for she would've known that
    the Marine had made a copy, and that the original is still in the
    library's database; also, if the principles of *anonymity* were
    practiced, their would only be a tracking system for physical
    copies-- not digital ones, since digital copies are not borrowed...
    _they're copied_!  *Part V* of this eBook provides real world
    examples of *Free/Libre Access*. \\

    The main reason-- _besides money_--  why authors write books, is so
    that people can read them.  By restricting access to books in a way
    that only a particular audience can read it, publishers and/or
    purveyors mistakenly send this message:  "=The author only wrote this
    book for this particular audience, and no one else will find this=
    =book interesting to read.="  This is why *Free/Libre Access* is so
    important!  Authors should maintain the attitude that if they ever
    distribute their books through restrictive channels, that it will be
    akin to saying: "=I don't want people to read my books!="  No one
    wants to make movies that no one will see; no one wants to make music
    that no one will hear; by the same token, no one wants to write books
    that no one will read.  *Free/Libre Access* allows users to make use
    of knowledge, and to distribute it to others if they find it useful.
    This type of cooperation fosters true education, because it allows us
    to learn from each other via books that are licensed, formatted, and
    distributed *freely*; however, in order to distribute an eBook
    *freely*, access policies in libraries and websites must make it
    legal to do so by conforming to *Free/Libre Access*.

* Why should we reject nonfree formats?
  + Free formats include, but are not limited to: HTML, [[http://pdfreaders.org/pdfreaders.en.html][PDF]], EPUB
    (without [[http://drm.info/][DRM]]), and plain ASCII[fn:2] text files.
    - _That does *NOT* include [[http://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Beware-proprietary-data-formats][nonfree formats]], such as:_
*** =.rtf= (Microsoft's Rich Text Format)
    {{{img-url(http://repositorium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/RtfConverter/Word2007RTFSpec9.pdf,RTF Specification,RTF Specification,http://interglacial.com/rtf/emacs/rtf-mode-examples.png,50%)}}} \\
    + This is a nonfree format; fortunately, Microsoft has published
      specifications for how it works.  Unfortunately, there are
      several different versions of this format, since it hasn't been
      standardized (we can't standardize it, since Microsoft owns
      it).

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    + =RTF= represents Microsoft Word's internal markup language, and
      the final version-- 1.9.1-- was released in 2007.  New features
      in Word 2010 and later will not save properly to the =RTF=
      format.
      + This format is human-readable; however, Microsoft Word can embed
        [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Linking_and_Embedding][binary objects (i.e. OLE)]], nonfree or patented image formats,
        and even macros into =RTF= files, which makes it insecure and
        incompatible with other =RTF= readers.  =RTF= does not support
        macros, but if you create a macro in a =DOC= file and then
        rename it with an =RTF= extension, then Microsoft Word will run
        all of the instructions in the macro anyway-- in other words,
        the macro becomes a gateway for malware.  =RTF= comes close to
        respecting the user's freedom; however, this format is insecure
        and nonfree-- just like Word files are (still a bigger
        improvement over Word, though).
        - The vulnerability concerning Microsoft Office™ macros is not
          theoretical, and is something that I've tested out myself.
          Word format-- like every other file format from Microsoft
          Office™-- is capable of storing macros, and thus =RTF= can
          as well since Word uses =RTF= as it's internal markup
          language.  A macro is a user-script or program that can be
          embedded into files in order to give them extra functionality
          that they wouldn't normally have on their own.  For instance,
          an Excel spreadsheet may contain a button in one of its cells
          called =Calculate=, which would call a function from a macro
          that someone has assigned to it.  Microsoft Office™ utilizes
          a programming language in order to allow users to write such
          functions.  It is called /Visual Basic for Applications/
          (VBA).
        - Macros can be malicious, because VBA has access to Windows
          objects and the filesystem itself.  It can be used to delete
          a file or create one.  Since all Microsoft Office™
          applications use the same language, and has access to each
          others programming objects: Each Microsoft Office™
          application has the capability of scripting the other.
          If a user activates the /Developer Option/ in Microsoft
          Office™, they'll have a chance to view the /VBA Project/;
          however, they won't be able to access the listed macros if
          the project is password-protected.
        - If you can't freely control or even see what a program is
          doing, then that program is *nonfree* for there is no way of
          determining whether the program is malicious or not.  When you
          run such a program you always exercise blind faith, because
          the owner has concealed the truth behind how the *nonfree*
          program operates, by restricting it via *nonfree* licensing
          and/or withholding the source code.  A user that is not
          familiar with macros may not understand the importance of
          disabling them, or why it is important to be able to see the
          source code of a macro if they trust it.  Malware is a real
          threat in Windows, so the user should always take
          precautions to ensure that their software is *free/libre* or
          can be replaced by a *free/libre* program; Windows itself
          is also *nonfree*, so relying on such a system is also an
          example of exercising blind faith (the good news is that it
          can also be replaced).
        - If the threat of malicious macros seems too far-fetched and
          you don't believe it: E-Mail me, and I'll send you an example
          file of a macro that is password-protected, and more than
          7,000 lines long.  It is not malware, but if I didn't also
          provide you with the password so that you can view the source
          code: There would be no way for you to tell the difference!
    + If you have a Microsoft =RTF= file, and you want to send it to
      someone in a format that respects their freedom: Convert it to
      HTML with [[http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/RTF_to_HTML][RTF to HTML]].

    + This format is based on OOXML (i.e. a patented format; XML,
      in contrast, is an /Open Standard/); not only that, but Word
      also utilizes formatting codes, and Microsoft Word is designed
      to embed ASCII text in an obfuscated form.  All of this makes
      it even harder to read Word files using different word
      processors, because the format is binary and no longer
      human-readable.

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
      - The main reasons for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscated_code][obfuscating code]] is to make it hard to
        read, and to prevent programmers from making software that
        works with the code-- there is no other purpose!  Internet,
        Networking, and /Open Standards/ are developed, documented,
        and published in order to promote clear and transparent
        communication-- this goes in stark contrast with nonfree
        programs and formats, which are owned by a proprietor and are
        often undocumented and hence unclear; this in turn, makes for
        poor interoperability and hence poor communication.
    + Since the format is undocumented, the /Free Software Movement/
      has been reverse-engineering Word format in order to read Word
      files; unfortunately, this effort becomes self-defeating when
      Microsoft is in control of the format, and can [[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html][change Word
      format]] at anytime.  To revise a file format in such a
      repetitive fashion, for the purposes of: Preventing
      interoperability with other word processors; preventing
      compatibility with /Open Standards/; preventing
      backwards-compatibility with other versions of the same
      format... _is malicious_!
    + Whilst the above reasons are substantial and should compel
      users to reject this defective format, one reason remains to be
      explained.  Word format should be rejected _on principle_,
      because it is a nonfree format that requires the use of a
      nonfree program-- a program, designed to take away the user's
      freedom.  This is reason enough for me to reject it as a viable
      medium for reading books-- or doing anything else, for that
      matter.
      - If you use Microsoft Word-- or other types of Nonfree
        Software, and you do not understand all of the implications
        and restrictions that comes with being a "licensee": E-Mail
        me, and I'll forward you a copy of the EULA that comes with
        Microsoft Office™.  Most people won't believe me until
        they've read the fine print, and I'll gladly inform them by
        providing a copy.  Users shouldn't be expected to be experts
        on licensing in order to find out if a program respects their
        freedoms or not; they should simply have the assurance that
        it does.  When it comes to Nonfree Software, however: There
        is no assurance; there is no freedom.
      - If you have a Microsoft Word document, and you want to send
        it to someone in a format that respects their freedom:
        Convert it to plain ASCII text with [[http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Docx2txt][Docx2txt]].

      is being fed nonfree browser scripts-- most are not aware of
      [[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html][the JavaScript Trap]].
      + I /attempted/ to purchase a book via Google's website to see
        if Google would respect my freedom to understand how the
        purchase was being made.  Well... they failed the test!
        Google uses a nonfree JavaScript, called [[https://wallet.google.com/inapp/lib/buy.js][buy.js]], that exists
        only in obfuscated form (i.e. function names are 2 letters
        long; no comments are included; no white space; no reference
        of where the source code is; etc.).  Imagine if this eBook
        used headings that were only 2 letters long; or if there was
        no whitespace in between each word-- would you consider such
        a book to be human-readable?  Even this very eBook comes
        packaged with source code, in case other Marines would like
        to update this documentation in their implementation of the
        /Marine Corps Professional Reading Program/-- so, why can't
        Google do the same for their online payment system?  They'll
        still have control over the purchase, but at least we'll know
        what they're doing with our payment information if the source
        code of their JavaScript was freed.  Inevitably, since I could
        not verify how Google would be using my payment information,
        and since I block nonfree JavaScript on principle-- I did not
        make the purchase.  The eBook only cost =$0.99=, but my
        freedom and security is worth more than that.
      + Google stores all purchased eBooks into their "cloud", which is
        just another buzzword for saying: _Your_ file, is on [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve][their
        server]].  This is unethical, because the default place that
        _your_ files should go to is _your_ device-- not theirs.
        Google should not require that you have an internet connection
        in order to read a book.  That's like having a librarian tell
        readers that they are only allowed to read books inside the
        library, but taking the book home for you to read is forbidden.
      + Google does provide a method for downloading some of the
        eBooks you may purchase, but the limits are set by the
        publisher.  If the publisher tells Google that users are not
        allowed to download a Google eBook, then those eBooks will
        display an alert message ("/No download files included/")
        before you purchase the eBook.  What exactly does that mean?
        It means that you need an internet connection in order to read
        those books, and you'll probably have to run nonfree

      ever devised.  [[http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/technolog/you-dont-own-your-kindle-books-amazon-reminds-customer-1C6626211][You do not own any copies of books]] purchased on
      the Amazon Kindle, and since Amazon practices [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in][Vendor Lock-in]]:
      Users can be sure that their *DRM*-encumbered content will
      *NOT* be portable to other devices-- unless of course, your
      alternate device is also infected with *DRM*; in which case,
      Amazon /may/ authorize you to copy the file over.  Remember,
      though, the file _you_ purchased belongs to them, not you--
      you are just a "licensee" of that eBook, and Amazon can
      remotely delete it whenever they want.
    + The /Amazon Kindle Fire/ truly lives up to its name, because
      Amazon can use the malware inside to commit massive digital
      book burnings.  They've already remotely deleted-- without the
      user's permission, of course-- hundreds of copies of /1984/
      by George Orwell, [[http://mashable.com/2009/07/17/amazon-kindle-1984/][in an orwellian act]] (if any of you have
      read the book).  George Orwell would turn in his grave if he
      knew that the fiction he wrote-- about a subjugated, censored,
      and surveilled society-- was actually non-fiction!
    + These are the facts, and soon... Amazon's eBook readers may
      start to behave like "smart" phones, by tracking you wherever
      you go.  After reading all of this, you're probably thinking
      that I've gone too far; however, I haven't gone far enough:
      [[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=8,073,460.PN.&OS=PN/8,073,460&RS=PN/8,073,460][Read this "mobile device travel patterns" patent]].  I know...
      it's hard to read, but what it represents is the boiler plate
      for spyware technology (you're "smart" phone uses the same type
      of technology); every technology-- whether it's malicious or
      not-- begins its life-cycle as a design first.  Most people
      think that patents are designed to promote progress, but did
      you know that they can also be used to threaten you?  Well, now
      you know!
    + All Proprietary Software companies subjugate their users by
      providing them Nonfree Software, so Amazon isn't alone in their
      quest for power over its users.  [[https://www.eff.org/pages/reader-privacy-chart-2012][Study this chart]], and learn
      about other offenders that provide eBook readers which affect
      your privacy by utilizing malware and/or restrictive policies.
    + One more thing... knowing that Amazon has so much control over
      Kindles, it only makes sense that users would want to take back
      some of that control in order to make their devices adapt to
      their needs.  People with the right technical know-how might be
      able to accomplish such a feat by /rooting/ (some call it /jail
      breaking/) their malicious devices, or by removing the *DRM*
      inside thereby circumventing the malware and subjugation that
      is imposed on all users.  Here's the problem, though: Kindles
      still require Nonfree Software in order to function (i.e. the
      firmware known as /Paperwhite/), and Amazon can use [[http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200774090][the
      universal backdoor]] in Kindles to remotely update them.  What
      exactly does that mean?  It means that during the process of
      "updating" a Kindle, Amazon will verify if the user is running
      the authorized jailed-version of the device.  If their device
      has been unlocked, [[https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150321/13350230396/while-bricking-jailbroken-fire-tvs-last-year-amazon-did-same-to-kindle-devices.shtml][Amazon will brick it]]!  To brick a device,
      means to render it non-functional.  In other words, the
      functionality of a Kindle will have been reduced to nothing
      more than a door-stopper if the user ever attempts to use it in
      freedom.  In order for users to have the freedom to control
      their Kindles, they must have the option to be able to install
      *Free Software* on it; unfortunately, that option can't even be
      provided until /Paperwhite/--firmware in Amazon's current
      control-- is reverse-engineered and replaced with a free/libre
      program that users *CAN* control.

    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    - I've mentioned that many of these formats impose *DRM* on the user.
      Proponents of this malware will argue that it provides a "[[http://www.drmtoday.com/how-it-works][secure
      reading system]]" due to its ability to encrypt files, so that no one
      can make readable copies; however, the system is only secure if
      *YOU* are the one who controls it!  If you have the keys to decrypt
      the *DRM*-encumbered file, then _you are in control_ of the file.
      If someone else has the keys to decrypt the *DRM*-encumbered
      file-- such as a private company (e.g. [[http://www.defectivebydesign.org/amazontagging][Amazon]], [[http://www.defectivebydesign.org/apple][Apple]], [[http://www.defectivebydesign.org/microsoft][Microsoft]],
      etc.), then _you are *NOT* in control_ of the file-- the owner of
      the *DRM* program is; thus, the owner can use this nonfree program
      as an instrument of unjust power over the user.
      - Besides being in control of your data, maybe you would like to
        make a digital copy of a media file for yourself to view on
        another device?  Well... in order to do that: _*DRM* must be
        removed!_
      - I won't attempt to explain the irony behind the practice of
        sharing unreadable, inaccessible files with users, and expecting
        those users to somehow be able to read or access them-- [[https://archive.org/details/dbdoct3_adcbicycle][that's an
        exercise for another day]].
    - Here are examples of [[http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Category/Hobbies/ebook-reader][eBook reading software that respects your
      freedom]].  These programs are *Free Software*, so users are able to
      control the program, and in turn, their reading experience-- a stark
      contrast to the above nonfree programs or formats.
    - Would you like to know more about *DRM*? Study these [[http://www.defectivebydesign.org/faq][Frequently Asked
      Questions]]!
      + I've also published an essay about *DRM*, how [[https://ia601701.us.archive.org/12/items/DRMAndFreeCulture/DrmAndFreeCulture.txt][it affects our
        society (written by another ethical author)]], and what we should do
        about it.  It's main focus is on *DRM* found in media streaming
        dis-services, but the same concepts and principles can be applied
        here.  The title of the essay, /What is the purpose of Genshiken/,
        can just as easily be replaced with: /What is the purpose of using
        Free Software and Free Formats/.  The essay is divided into three
        parts:
	1. http://www.nongnu.org/genshiken/#orgheadline1
	2. http://www.nongnu.org/genshiken/#orgheadline2
	3. http://www.nongnu.org/genshiken/#orgheadline3
      + When I mention that *DRM* books are unreadable, what that means is
        that the book is encrypted in such a way that it can only be read
        using malware.  The malware is given the keys to decrypt the book
        by the proprietor, so that you can read it.  Unfortunately, in the
        proprietor's quest for power over you: They've decided not to give
        you a copy of the key!  What does that mean?  It means that even
        though you have a digital copy of the book, you are not able to
        decrypt the file yourself-- which also means you can't make
        readable copies to display on other devices you own.  Since *DRM*
        takes away control of your own data, the /Free Software Movement/
        considers it malware.  Imagine if your camera stored decades worth
        of family pictures, and you wanted to share some of them on social
        media: If the camera is infected with *DRM*, then you will not be
        able to share your own files with your friends and family... this
        is malware at its finest ([[https://archive.org/details/RedTouchMediaDigitalRightsManagementSystemInSaltLakeCity][some companies even advertise their
        malware]])!
      + *DRM* is also required in order to engage in [[http://www.moneycrashers.com/rent-borrow-ebooks-online/][eBook lending]], so
        _don't be fooled_!  Ask yourself these questions: Does it make
        sense to /borrow/ digital information?  Why can't libraries,
        vendors, or purveyors simply send you a copy of the eBook, without
        forcing you to give up control of your computing?  Why go through
        the trouble of removing a copy of an eBook from the "owner", and
        then copying the eBook to the "borrower"?  What stops the user
        from making a copy of the eBook-- while it's in /their/ digital
        library-- in the first place?  What kind of digital system exists
        today that prevents people from making readable copies?  Does it
        even make sense to make a book /unreadable/ when the main purpose
        of acquiring a book is to *read* it?  Now that the "borrower" has a
        copy of the eBook, they'll only be able to keep the eBook in
        their library for only 14 days; after which, the proprietor that
        controls the *DRM* in the device will delete it and send it back to
        the "owner".  Does it make sense for someone besides you to delete
        files on your device-- even if you are not the "owner" of the
        file?  Does it make sense to even call something a "library" when
        it can only store /disappearing/ books?  Malware is what makes this
        all possible!  Share copies of your eBooks, but do not lend them,
        for the only way to implement a lending system is through the use
        of access restrictions controlled by _Digital Restrictions
        Management_ (*DRM*)-- which is malware, no matter how convenient it
        seems.  Lending books /physically/ doesn't require malware-- only
        trust and cooperation.
    - Wondering why I didn't list any eBook readers that *DO* respect
      your freedom?  Well... I haven't listed any, because they don't
      exist.  I can't list any right now, but hopefully in the future I'll
      be able to.  Currently, the only way to read eBooks in freedom is
      through [[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/keep-control-of-your-computing.html][a computer that you have full control of]].  Can you [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/can-you-trust.html][trust your

    This particular subject goes beyond the scope of this eBook, but it
    does have an impact on computing and is a /Technical Protection
    Measure/-- just like *DRM* is.
    
* Are there any resources available for accessing books online?
  Yes, but they are hard to come by since most books are copyrighted and
  are either distributed with/without a license that restricts the user.

  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  The main nonfree restriction preventing users from copying and sharing
  files, is a clause that says that the owner has exclusive rights to the
  _use and distribution_ of the work; thus, the work is considered
  /nonfree/, because only the owner can *freely* control what he/she does
  with the work-- _not the users_.

  Due to these problems, it is illegal in most circumstances to release a
  free/libre version online that people can share-- nonfree technical
  works, however, *CAN* be replaced fairly easily with a free/libre
  version.  In essence, a book has to either respect your freedom from
  the start by including a free/libre license under its Copyright page,
  or it needs to be considered public domain material in order for users
  to freely use and share it with each other.

  *Project Gutenburg:* \\
  - Beware of nonfree formats, like Kindle files!

    provider takes away control of your files, [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.en.html][on their server]]? \\

  *The Small Wars Journal:* \\
  This is not the perfect example of *Free/Libre Access*, because of
  the restriction  preventing commercial distribution; however, it's
  still a great resource that you may distribute to others gratis.
  Here's a quote from their website:

      practitioners, thought leaders, and students of Small Wars, in order
      to advance knowledge and capabilities in the field.  We hope this, in
      turn, advances the practice and effectiveness of those forces

 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. \\
\\
*0. PREAMBLE* \\

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
#+REVEAL: split
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. \\
\\
#+REVEAL: split
*1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS* \\

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
#+REVEAL: split
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
#+REVEAL: split
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
#+REVEAL: split
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
#+REVEAL: split
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
#+REVEAL: split
The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License. \\
\\
#+REVEAL: split
*2. VERBATIM COPYING* \\

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.\\
\\
#+REVEAL: split
*3. COPYING IN QUANTITY* \\

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
#+REVEAL: split
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
#+REVEAL: split
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document. \\
\\
#+REVEAL: split
*4. MODIFICATIONS* \\

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
#+REVEAL: split
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
#+REVEAL: split
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
#+REVEAL: split
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
#+REVEAL: split
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
#+REVEAL: split
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version. \\
\\
#+REVEAL: split
*5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS* \\

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
#+REVEAL: split
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements". \\
\\
#+REVEAL: split
*6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS* \\

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document. \\
\\
#+REVEAL: split
*7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS* \\

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate. \\
\\
#+REVEAL: split
*8. TRANSLATION* \\

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title. \\
\\
#+REVEAL: split
*9. TERMINATION* \\

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
#+REVEAL: split
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it. \\
\\
#+REVEAL: split
*10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE* \\

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document. \\
\\
#+REVEAL: split
*11. RELICENSING* \\

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit 
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, 
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license 
published by that same organization.
#+REVEAL: split
"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in 
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this 
License, and if all works that were first published under this License 
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or 
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and 
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. \\
\\
#+REVEAL: split
_*ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents*_ \\

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".
#+REVEAL: split
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

*DRM* was not implemented at the time, though... could /Amazon Prime/ be a
more malicious replacement for /Amazon Unbox/, with *DRM* inside?  Several
users have [[http://www.amazon.com/forum/amazon%20prime?cdForum=Fx19TKUDUCVHDNP&cdThread=Tx19HPH8H35E889][already answered this question via experience]].  Poor
interoperability is only one consequence of malware, like *DRM*-- I can
cite several other consequences, but that would distract you from the main
point: Amazon's /black box/ technology (i.e. a technology whose
inner-workings are censored) is nonfree; thus, you can't control it!

[fn:2] American Standard Code for Information Interchange.  *Allin

[fn:1] It's important to note that I use the word *free* a lot.  Most
people don't realize, though, that there exists a bug in the English
language-- the different meanings of the word *free*.  Whenever I say that
something costs nothing or is devoid of price, I don't say that it's free--
I say that it's gratis.  Whenever I say that you are able to use that
something however you wish-- this is when I define it as *free*, or [[http://wikieducator.org/Say_Libre][libre]].
When it comes to eBooks, it is important to denote whether the eBook is
either free as in [[http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:No_Cost_or_Freedom%3F][no cost or freedom]].  In the case of this eBook, it is
both free and gratis (the official distribution is gratis, but others may
sell it at a price if they wish; the book is *free*, after all... if you
were confused by that, then you are aware of the bug).

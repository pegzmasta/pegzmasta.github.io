It's not always possible to go to the base library to borrow a book, and
there's always a chance that they might only have a limited number of
copies per book, or maybe even none at all.
</p>

<p>
In light of all this, we will be using digital copies whenever we can.
In order to ensure that everyone can access and read these copies: The
files will only be distributed if it is written in a <a href="https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/opendocument/reject">free and/or

While there are <a href="https://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2011/spring/the-danger-of-ebooks">several reasons to reject nonfree eBook formats</a>&#x2026;
<a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/kindle-fire">several</a>, the main reason is to promote accessibility between all users,
and to encourage <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html">the Right to Read</a>.
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
When I first started researching about the <i>Marine Corps Professional
Reading Program</i>, my first step was to read about the official guidance&#x2013;
<code>ALMAR 001/13</code>.  It seemed like a solid plan; however, it's current
execution is flawed!  Most purveyors of eBooks utilize nonfree
technology, nonfree formats, and maintain restrictions on accessing
books.  Most authors, unfortunately, also distribute books using nonfree
licensing which contain restrictions on the use of books, and prevents
sharing.  The execution of the <i>Marine Corps Professional Reading
Program</i> is not flawed due to any fault of Marines; it is flawed, because
we rely on defective technologies (i.e. Nonfree Software; nonfree
formats; malicious technical measures; more about this later) and
restrictive policies (i.e. nonfree licensing; price barriers and/or
access barriers; etc .) which we are not always in a position to fix.
</p>

<p>
These aforementioned obstacles do <b>NOT</b> promote reading&#x2013; they hinder it!
The first step in solving this problem is to recognize its existence.
Once we've acknowledged that, we can begin to circumvent these obstacles
and start supporting ethical authors, purveyors, organizations,
technologies, and distribution websites.  Once everyone has recognized
this problem, only then can it be solved and circumvention will no
longer be required.

</p>

<p>
If defective digital technologies did not exist, then <i>anyone</i> would be
able to read <i>A Message to Garcia</i>.  Does it make sense to add a
<i>Technological Protection Measure</i> to books that are in the <b>Public

scramble the text in the message (i.e. Encryption), and then encodes
said messages into secret formats?

I will explain the consequences of accepting defective technologies and
restrictive licensing or policies below, and why we should reject them on
principle.  An example of a freely<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> licensed eBook from the
<i>Commandant's Professional Reading List</i>, which is encoded in a free
format (the Kindle version is <b>NOT</b> a free format&#x2013; <span class="underline">avoid it</span>; I'll
explain in more detail below), is located at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17195">http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17195</a>.  Such a book can be freely read,
copied, and shared without any legal consequences&#x2013; provided that the
user reads and abides by the license.  Official Marine Corps guidance on
the professional reading program is also provided, as well as resources
for Marines if they wish to continue their reading or education online.

As you can see, reading can be fun!  More importantly, eBooks can be
educational, and can present new ideas and concepts that can inspire
critical thinking, while fine-tuning your awareness of ethics&#x2013; which
plays an important role in what choices you make!  This is exactly what
I've set out to do in this eBook, and I welcome your feedback.

<p>
A guide is provided for future authors who are willing to contribute
books that can be freely used and distributed, so that we can have
control of the knowledge without the interference of a proprietor.

<h2 id="orgheadline10">What principles do I propose for supporting an ethical reading program?</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>
According to `Section 6' of <code>ALMAR 001/13</code>, the Marine Corps is putting
forth maximum effort towards obtaining print, electronic, and audio
formats for each book.  This was written over 2 years ago, and acquiring
books is still a difficult process!  I propose an ethical execution of
this plan, in order to ensure that it succeeds for <b>MAG-49</b> and
everywhere else.  In order to do this, we need authors to start writing
books in a more ethical way.  Below, I attempt to detail the life-cycle
of creating a book in an ethical manner; from the methods we choose to
create a book; from the licenses we choose to release it under; from how
it should be encoded once we finish writing the book; and finally, from
how it should be released so that anyone can access it.  This very eBook
is written in the spirit of <a href="http://wikieducator.org/Libre/Knowledge">libre knowledge</a>, and is an example of a
<b>free</b> eBook.
</p>

</aside>
<ul>
<li>I propose that four basic principles should be followed; hopefully,
all authors, purveyors, vendors, and libraries will follow suit&#x2013; they
should be applied to eBooks and printed books alike:</li>

<p>
This particular principle is merely a recommendation&#x2013; not a
requisite.  The author may choose to write their book using whatever
technology they deem suitable for the task; likewise, the user may
also choose to read a book using whatever technology they deem
suitable for the task.  This principle is listed here, because after
listing the defects of Nonfree Software and formats in <b>Part IV</b> of
this eBook: It only makes sense to also include a solution that is
devoid of such defects.  While there exists a plethora of reasons for
using and supporting <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free/libre software</a>, I will only focus on three
reasons why <b>Free Software</b> should be used for creating an eBook.
Here is a <a href="http://directory.fsf.org/wiki?fulltext=Search&amp;profile=default&amp;title=Special:Search&amp;search=books">listing of Free Software</a> that can handle opening, editing,
managing, creating, publishing, and collecting eBooks.
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Control</b> <br  />
Only <b>Free Software</b> gives users the <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">freedom to control their
programs</a>.  <b>Free Software</b> gives users the legal rights necessary
for controlling their software; in other words, a free/libre
program provides users the <a href="http://fsfe.org/activities/ftf/faq-what-is-licensing.en.html">permissions (via a free license)</a> and the
means (via the <a href="http://fsfe.org/freesoftware/basics/sourcecode.en.html">source code</a> and documentation) necessary for making
their programs operate the way that they wish.  An author using a
free/libre program will have full control of the writing process,
and can even verify that the program is indeed following their
commands by inspecting the source code of a program.  There exists
eBooks which are <a href="https://livinglibre1.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/sharethisbook_finished.pdf">freely licensed to allow modification and
sharing</a>; however, without the source code&#x2026; <span class="underline">you can't modify
it!</span> <br  />
 The source code represents the preferred version of a program
required for making changes to it.  This very eBook comes with
source code that can also be used as a Transparent copy of this
eBook for modification purposes; they include
<code>the-principles-of-an-ethical-reading-program.org</code> (the
corresponding source code of this eBook) and
<code>the-principles-of-an-ethical-reading-program.html</code> (the actual
source code of this eBook).  Knowing the freedoms that comes with
<b>Free Software</b>, an author is also more likely to license their
eBooks to have the same kinds of freedom, so that users can freely
use and distribute their work.</li>
<li><b>Accessibility</b> <br  />
The second reason why an author should write their books using
<b>Free Software</b> is to promote accessibility.  A free/libre program
encodes its data to a free/libre format <span class="underline">by default</span>.  This is
important, because certain programs may not save a file in a way
that is accessible to all users.  Certain programs may even install
user-scripts into their format, and sometimes even malware!  The
user-scripts are harmless if they're under your control, but that
may not always be the case.  Malware, on the other hand, is usually
under the control of a proprietor who wishes to abuse and take
advantage of users.  It may seem far-fetched to commit such a
malpractice, but I can assure you that it does happen&#x2013; <b>Part IV</b>
of this eBook will detail these type of attacks on your freedom.</li>
<li><b>Cooperation</b> <br  />
The third reason why an author should write their books using
<b>Free Software</b> is to promote cooperation.  If the author is
writing a fictional work, an art related piece, or maybe even
an entertaining script or poetry, then there is really no need
for them to provide the source code for their eBook.  If the
author is writing a more functional work, an instructional manual,
or some sort of reference book or educational work, then they may
want to release the source code for their work in order to gather
participation in the development of the eBook.  Authors that use
<b>Free Software</b>, are more likely to release the source code for
their eBooks (I will henceforth be referring to the source code
of documents by another term, <i>Transparent copy</i>, in order to be
clearer). <br  />
 Why do I say this?  With <b>Free Software</b>, it is considered normal
for users to have access to the source code of their programs, so
that they can control it.  <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html">Free Software also needs Free
Documentation</a>, because we want users to learn <b>how</b> to control
their software.  Whenever we improve our software we also want to
update our documentation to reflect the changes.  If we create
version 3 of a program with twice as many features as version 2,
then it makes sense to also release another version of said
documentation; otherwise, the user won't know how to use all the
new features provided in the program. <br  />
 <i>Free Documentation</i> isn't just for software, though.  It can be
used for any type of reference or technical work.  If we
distribute works using licenses that do not permit this type of
cooperation, then whenever we need to update a work of knowledge
about any given subject: We would have to literally recreate that

In order to promote the right to read an eBook or printed book, and
share it if we like it: All versions of a book should have a license
that makes it legal to do so; thus, authors should apply a <a href="http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses">free/libre
license</a> to their book.  The take-away: <span class="underline">A <b>Free/Libre License</b> respects
the users freedom and community.</span> <br  />
</p>

<p>
These are <b>free</b> as in freedom licenses, which has nothing to do
with price!  An author may choose to distribute his/her work as
gratis (i.e. it costs nothing), or at a price; they may even choose
to distribute gratis digital copies and priced physical copies, and
vice versa.  The key, is that an author or publisher shouldn't be in
control of what someone does with his/her work once a copy has been
acquired, because if they do: The user is <b>NOT</b> free to read and
share the work.  We don't want our eBooks to turn into
<i>walled-gardens</i>; otherwise, we can't control how we use these books.
No one can control the content or media inside of a <i>walled-garden</i>,
but they do have control of the content or media inside of a <b>freely</b>
licensed book.  This is why I'm pushing for authors to apply a free
license to their eBooks: If they can do this, then the rest of these
principles can be applied as well; finally, the user won't be
subjugated in their use of an eBook (a flaw that even <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/online-education.html">affects

<p>
In order to promote interoperability between all devices and
operating systems: We must insist that eBooks are encoded in a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_file_format">free/libre file format</a>.  Nonfree formats are not recommended for
sharing, because they are undocumented; incompatible with <a href="http://documentfreedom.org/openstandards.en.html">Open
Standards</a>; requires the use of <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/proprietary.html">Nonfree Software</a>; and some,
unfortunately, are infected with malware.  When a document is saved
in a format that is documented; conforms to <i>Open Standards</i>; is
accessible with <i>Free Software</i>; and finally, can be revised
straightforwardly in a text editor: That file is considered to be a
Transparent copy, because it can be clearly seen and modified easily.
With programs, we need the source code to modify them; with
documents, we need a Transparent copy to modify them. <br  />
</p>

<p>
With a Transparent copy of an eBook, such  as a <code>.txt</code>, <code>.html</code>,
or <code>.tex</code> file, the user can read the book using an ordinary text
editor; not only that, but they can update the knowledge&#x2013; fixing
any typos in grammar, spelling, and diction; maybe there are
hyperlinks that are no longer functional anymore which need to be
replaced; maybe the concepts inside the eBook have advanced in
today's current society, to the point where the eBook is no longer
accurate anymore.  Wouldn't these factors warrant a new version of
the eBook to be released?  What if the author is not able to make
these changes?  How else can we release a modified version of the
eBook?  With <b>Free Software</b>, not only do users have <b>individual
control</b>, but they also have the means to exercise <b>collective
control</b> as well.  With <i>Free Documentation</i>, the same can be said!
As long as a freely licensed Transparent copy of the eBook exists,
<b>anyone</b> can edit the eBook and release their own modified version&#x2013;
<span class="underline">without the authors permission</span> (they still have to respect the
license; we don't want to modify invariant sections, for this would
alter and misrepresent an author's point-of-view). <br  />
</p>

<p>
Instead of sharing secret, proprietary, media files&#x2026; we will only
share files whose formats are documented, and can be read just as
easily as a book can be.  Just like this very eBook adheres to a
documented and Open Standard, other eBooks should also be the same.
An eBook in a free format provides users the same freedoms that they
would normally have when reading a printed book.

If a digital copy can only be accessed by identifying yourself
through an authentication system, then that system itself is nonfree
for it has control over who accesses the book&#x2013; this goes against
the concept of <a href="https://stallman.org/articles/free-scientific-publishing.html">Free/Libre Access</a> and <b>anonymity</b>.  The idea of
identifying yourself makes sense for borrowing a physical copy of a
book, because the library will now know who to contact if they don't
return it.  It does <b>NOT</b> make sense for digital copies, because of
the mere fact that it is impossible to <i>borrow</i> something as
<i>intangible</i> as digital information (i.e. one can not <i>physically</i>
take something that has no <i>physical</i> form); on the contrary, it is
possible to copy digital information.  I can see it now as a
librarian asks, "<code>Good afternoon, Marine!  Our records indicate that
    you borrowed a set of ones and zeroes the other day (i.e. an</code>
<code>eBook), and it appears that the data is now overdue.  Could you
    please return the information to us, so that other users can read</code>
<code>the numbers?</code>" This malpractice is similar to <i>eBook lending</i>
(I'll explain later). <br  />
</p>

<p>
If the principles of <b>Free/Libre Access</b> were applied, the librarian
would never ask such a silly question for she would've known that
the Marine had made a copy, and that the original is still in the
library's database; also, if the principles of <b>anonymity</b> were
practiced, their would only be a tracking system for physical
copies&#x2013; not digital ones, since digital copies are not borrowed&#x2026;
<span class="underline">they're copied</span>!  <b>Part V</b> of this eBook provides real world
examples of <b>Free/Libre Access</b>. <br  />
</p>

<p>
The main reason&#x2013; <span class="underline">besides money</span>&#x2013;  why authors write books, is so
that people can read them.  By restricting access to books in a way
that only a particular audience can read it, publishers and/or
purveyors mistakenly send this message:  "<code>The author only wrote this
    book for this particular audience, and no one else will find this</code>
<code>book interesting to read.</code>"  This is why <b>Free/Libre Access</b> is so
important!  Authors should maintain the attitude that if they ever
distribute their books through restrictive channels, that it will be
akin to saying: "<code>I don't want people to read my books!</code>"  No one
wants to make movies that no one will see; no one wants to make music
that no one will hear; by the same token, no one wants to write books
that no one will read.  <b>Free/Libre Access</b> allows users to make use
of knowledge, and to distribute it to others if they find it useful.
This type of cooperation fosters true education, because it allows us
to learn from each other via books that are licensed, formatted, and
distributed <b>freely</b>; however, in order to distribute an eBook
<b>freely</b>, access policies in libraries and websites must make it
legal to do so by conforming to <b>Free/Libre Access</b>.

</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a nonfree format; fortunately, Microsoft has published
specifications for how it works.  Unfortunately, there are
several different versions of this format, since it hasn't been
standardized (we can't standardize it, since Microsoft owns
it).</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li><code>RTF</code> represents Microsoft Word's internal markup language, and
the final version&#x2013; 1.9.1&#x2013; was released in 2007.  New features
in Word 2010 and later will not save properly to the <code>RTF</code>
format.
<ul>
<li>This format is human-readable; however, Microsoft Word can embed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Linking_and_Embedding">binary objects (i.e. OLE)</a>, nonfree or patented image formats,
and even macros into <code>RTF</code> files, which makes it insecure and
incompatible with other <code>RTF</code> readers.  <code>RTF</code> does not support
macros, but if you create a macro in a <code>DOC</code> file and then
rename it with an <code>RTF</code> extension, then Microsoft Word will run
all of the instructions in the macro anyway&#x2013; in other words,
the macro becomes a gateway for malware.  <code>RTF</code> comes close to
respecting the user's freedom; however, this format is insecure
and nonfree&#x2013; just like Word files are (still a bigger
improvement over Word, though).
<ul>
<li>The vulnerability concerning Microsoft Office™ macros is not
theoretical, and is something that I've tested out myself.
Word format&#x2013; like every other file format from Microsoft
Office™&#x2013; is capable of storing macros, and thus <code>RTF</code> can
as well since Word uses <code>RTF</code> as it's internal markup
language.  A macro is a user-script or program that can be
embedded into files in order to give them extra functionality
that they wouldn't normally have on their own.  For instance,
an Excel spreadsheet may contain a button in one of its cells
called <code>Calculate</code>, which would call a function from a macro
that someone has assigned to it.  Microsoft Office™ utilizes
a programming language in order to allow users to write such
functions.  It is called <i>Visual Basic for Applications</i>
(VBA).</li>
<li>Macros can be malicious, because VBA has access to Windows
objects and the filesystem itself.  It can be used to delete
a file or create one.  Since all Microsoft Office™
applications use the same language, and has access to each
others programming objects: Each Microsoft Office™
application has the capability of scripting the other.
If a user activates the <i>Developer Option</i> in Microsoft
Office™, they'll have a chance to view the <i>VBA Project</i>;
however, they won't be able to access the listed macros if
the project is password-protected.</li>
<li>If you can't freely control or even see what a program is
doing, then that program is <b>nonfree</b> for there is no way of
determining whether the program is malicious or not.  When you
run such a program you always exercise blind faith, because
the owner has concealed the truth behind how the <b>nonfree</b>
program operates, by restricting it via <b>nonfree</b> licensing
and/or withholding the source code.  A user that is not
familiar with macros may not understand the importance of
disabling them, or why it is important to be able to see the
source code of a macro if they trust it.  Malware is a real
threat in Windows, so the user should always take
precautions to ensure that their software is <b>free/libre</b> or
can be replaced by a <b>free/libre</b> program; Windows itself
is also <b>nonfree</b>, so relying on such a system is also an
example of exercising blind faith (the good news is that it
can also be replaced).</li>
<li>If the threat of malicious macros seems too far-fetched and
you don't believe it: E-Mail me, and I'll send you an example
file of a macro that is password-protected, and more than
7,000 lines long.  It is not malware, but if I didn't also
provide you with the password so that you can view the source
code: There would be no way for you to tell the difference!</li>

</ul></li>

<li>If you have a Microsoft <code>RTF</code> file, and you want to send it to
someone in a format that respects their freedom: Convert it to

<ul>
<li>This format is based on OOXML (i.e. a patented format; XML,
in contrast, is an <i>Open Standard</i>); not only that, but Word
also utilizes formatting codes, and Microsoft Word is designed
to embed ASCII text in an obfuscated form.  All of this makes
it even harder to read Word files using different word
processors, because the format is binary and no longer
human-readable.</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>The main reasons for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscated_code">obfuscating code</a> is to make it hard to
read, and to prevent programmers from making software that
works with the code&#x2013; there is no other purpose!  Internet,
Networking, and <i>Open Standards</i> are developed, documented,
and published in order to promote clear and transparent
communication&#x2013; this goes in stark contrast with nonfree
programs and formats, which are owned by a proprietor and are
often undocumented and hence unclear; this in turn, makes for
poor interoperability and hence poor communication.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Since the format is undocumented, the <i>Free Software Movement</i>
has been reverse-engineering Word format in order to read Word
files; unfortunately, this effort becomes self-defeating when
Microsoft is in control of the format, and can <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html">change Word
format</a> at anytime.  To revise a file format in such a
repetitive fashion, for the purposes of: Preventing
interoperability with other word processors; preventing
compatibility with <i>Open Standards</i>; preventing
backwards-compatibility with other versions of the same
format&#x2026; <span class="underline">is malicious</span>!</li>
<li>Whilst the above reasons are substantial and should compel
users to reject this defective format, one reason remains to be
explained.  Word format should be rejected <span class="underline">on principle</span>,
because it is a nonfree format that requires the use of a
nonfree program&#x2013; a program, designed to take away the user's
freedom.  This is reason enough for me to reject it as a viable
medium for reading books&#x2013; or doing anything else, for that
matter.
<ul>
<li>If you use Microsoft Word&#x2013; or other types of Nonfree
Software, and you do not understand all of the implications
and restrictions that comes with being a "licensee": E-Mail
me, and I'll forward you a copy of the EULA that comes with
Microsoft Office™.  Most people won't believe me until
they've read the fine print, and I'll gladly inform them by
providing a copy.  Users shouldn't be expected to be experts
on licensing in order to find out if a program respects their
freedoms or not; they should simply have the assurance that
it does.  When it comes to Nonfree Software, however: There
is no assurance; there is no freedom.</li>
<li>If you have a Microsoft Word document, and you want to send
it to someone in a format that respects their freedom:
Convert it to plain ASCII text with <a href="http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Docx2txt">Docx2txt</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li>I <i>attempted</i> to purchase a book via Google's website to see
if Google would respect my freedom to understand how the
purchase was being made.  Well&#x2026; they failed the test!
Google uses a nonfree JavaScript, called <a href="https://wallet.google.com/inapp/lib/buy.js">buy.js</a>, that exists
only in obfuscated form (i.e. function names are 2 letters
long; no comments are included; no white space; no reference
of where the source code is; etc.).  Imagine if this eBook
used headings that were only 2 letters long; or if there was
no whitespace in between each word&#x2013; would you consider such
a book to be human-readable?  Even this very eBook comes
packaged with source code, in case other Marines would like
to update this documentation in their implementation of the
<i>Marine Corps Professional Reading Program</i>&#x2013; so, why can't
Google do the same for their online payment system?  They'll
still have control over the purchase, but at least we'll know
what they're doing with our payment information if the source
code of their JavaScript was freed.  Inevitably, since I could
not verify how Google would be using my payment information,
and since I block nonfree JavaScript on principle&#x2013; I did not
make the purchase.  The eBook only cost <code>$0.99</code>, but my
freedom and security is worth more than that.</li>
<li>Google stores all purchased eBooks into their "cloud", which is
just another buzzword for saying: <span class="underline">Your</span> file, is on <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve">their
server</a>.  This is unethical, because the default place that
<span class="underline">your</span> files should go to is <span class="underline">your</span> device&#x2013; not theirs.
Google should not require that you have an internet connection
in order to read a book.  That's like having a librarian tell
readers that they are only allowed to read books inside the
library, but taking the book home for you to read is forbidden.</li>
<li>Google does provide a method for downloading some of the
eBooks you may purchase, but the limits are set by the
publisher.  If the publisher tells Google that users are not
allowed to download a Google eBook, then those eBooks will
display an alert message ("<i>No download files included</i>")
before you purchase the eBook.  What exactly does that mean?
It means that you need an internet connection in order to read
those books, and you'll probably have to run nonfree
JavaScript in order to do so&#x2013; which is a trap.</li>

it's hard to read, but what it represents is the boiler plate
for spyware technology (you're "smart" phone uses the same type
of technology); every technology&#x2013; whether it's malicious or
not&#x2013; begins its life-cycle as a design first.  Most people
think that patents are designed to promote progress, but did
you know that they can also be used to threaten you?  Well, now

<li>All Proprietary Software companies subjugate their users by
providing them Nonfree Software, so Amazon isn't alone in their
quest for power over its users.  <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/reader-privacy-chart-2012">Study this chart</a>, and learn
about other offenders that provide eBook readers which affect
your privacy by utilizing malware and/or restrictive policies.</li>
<li>One more thing&#x2026; knowing that Amazon has so much control over
Kindles, it only makes sense that users would want to take back
some of that control in order to make their devices adapt to
their needs.  People with the right technical know-how might be
able to accomplish such a feat by <i>rooting</i> (some call it <i>jail
breaking</i>) their malicious devices, or by removing the <b>DRM</b>
inside thereby circumventing the malware and subjugation that
is imposed on all users.  Here's the problem, though: Kindles
still require Nonfree Software in order to function (i.e. the
firmware known as <i>Paperwhite</i>), and Amazon can use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200774090">the
universal backdoor</a> in Kindles to remotely update them.  What
exactly does that mean?  It means that during the process of
"updating" a Kindle, Amazon will verify if the user is running
the authorized jailed-version of the device.  If their device
has been unlocked, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150321/13350230396/while-bricking-jailbroken-fire-tvs-last-year-amazon-did-same-to-kindle-devices.shtml">Amazon will brick it</a>!  To brick a device,
means to render it non-functional.  In other words, the
functionality of a Kindle will have been reduced to nothing
more than a door-stopper if the user ever attempts to use it in
freedom.  In order for users to have the freedom to control
their Kindles, they must have the option to be able to install
<b>Free Software</b> on it; unfortunately, that option can't even be
provided until <i>Paperwhite</i>&#x2013;firmware in Amazon's current
control&#x2013; is reverse-engineered and replaced with a free/libre
program that users <b>CAN</b> control.</li>

<li>I've mentioned that many of these formats impose <b>DRM</b> on the user.
Proponents of this malware will argue that it provides a "<a href="http://www.drmtoday.com/how-it-works">secure
reading system</a>" due to its ability to encrypt files, so that no one
can make readable copies; however, the system is only secure if
<b>YOU</b> are the one who controls it!  If you have the keys to decrypt
the <b>DRM</b>-encumbered file, then <span class="underline">you are in control</span> of the file.
If someone else has the keys to decrypt the <b>DRM</b>-encumbered
file&#x2013; such as a private company (e.g. <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/amazontagging">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/apple">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/microsoft">Microsoft</a>,
etc.), then <span class="underline">you are <b>NOT</b> in control</span> of the file&#x2013; the owner of
the <b>DRM</b> program is; thus, the owner can use this nonfree program
as an instrument of unjust power over the user.
<ul>
<li>Besides being in control of your data, maybe you would like to
make a digital copy of a media file for yourself to view on
another device?  Well&#x2026; in order to do that: <span class="underline"><b>DRM</b> must be
removed!</span></li>
<li>I won't attempt to explain the irony behind the practice of
sharing unreadable, inaccessible files with users, and expecting
those users to somehow be able to read or access them&#x2013; <a href="https://archive.org/details/dbdoct3_adcbicycle">that's an
exercise for another day</a>.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Here are examples of <a href="http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Category/Hobbies/ebook-reader">eBook reading software that respects your
freedom</a>.  These programs are <b>Free Software</b>, so users are able to
control the program, and in turn, their reading experience&#x2013; a stark
contrast to the above nonfree programs or formats.</li>
<li>Would you like to know more about <b>DRM</b>? Study these <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/faq">Frequently Asked
Questions</a>!
<ul>
<li>I've also published an essay about <b>DRM</b>, how <a href="https://ia601701.us.archive.org/12/items/DRMAndFreeCulture/DrmAndFreeCulture.txt">it affects our
society (written by another ethical author)</a>, and what we should do
about it.  It's main focus is on <b>DRM</b> found in media streaming
dis-services, but the same concepts and principles can be applied
here.  The title of the essay, <i>What is the purpose of Genshiken</i>,
can just as easily be replaced with: <i>What is the purpose of using
Free Software and Free Formats</i>.  The essay is divided into three
parts:
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.nongnu.org/genshiken/#orgheadline1">http://www.nongnu.org/genshiken/#orgheadline1</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nongnu.org/genshiken/#orgheadline2">http://www.nongnu.org/genshiken/#orgheadline2</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nongnu.org/genshiken/#orgheadline3">http://www.nongnu.org/genshiken/#orgheadline3</a></li>

</ol></li>
<li>When I mention that <b>DRM</b> books are unreadable, what that means is
that the book is encrypted in such a way that it can only be read
using malware.  The malware is given the keys to decrypt the book
by the proprietor, so that you can read it.  Unfortunately, in the
proprietor's quest for power over you: They've decided not to give
you a copy of the key!  What does that mean?  It means that even
though you have a digital copy of the book, you are not able to
decrypt the file yourself&#x2013; which also means you can't make
readable copies to display on other devices you own.  Since <b>DRM</b>
takes away control of your own data, the <i>Free Software Movement</i>
considers it malware.  Imagine if your camera stored decades worth
of family pictures, and you wanted to share some of them on social
media: If the camera is infected with <b>DRM</b>, then you will not be
able to share your own files with your friends and family&#x2026; this
is malware at its finest (<a href="https://archive.org/details/RedTouchMediaDigitalRightsManagementSystemInSaltLakeCity">some companies even advertise their
malware</a>)!</li>
<li><b>DRM</b> is also required in order to engage in <a href="http://www.moneycrashers.com/rent-borrow-ebooks-online/">eBook lending</a>, so
<span class="underline">don't be fooled</span>!  Ask yourself these questions: Does it make
sense to <i>borrow</i> digital information?  Why can't libraries,
vendors, or purveyors simply send you a copy of the eBook, without
forcing you to give up control of your computing?  Why go through
the trouble of removing a copy of an eBook from the "owner", and
then copying the eBook to the "borrower"?  What stops the user
from making a copy of the eBook&#x2013; while it's in <i>their</i> digital
library&#x2013; in the first place?  What kind of digital system exists
today that prevents people from making readable copies?  Does it
even make sense to make a book <i>unreadable</i> when the main purpose
of acquiring a book is to <b>read</b> it?  Now that the "borrower" has a
copy of the eBook, they'll only be able to keep the eBook in
their library for only 14 days; after which, the proprietor that
controls the <b>DRM</b> in the device will delete it and send it back to
the "owner".  Does it make sense for someone besides you to delete
files on your device&#x2013; even if you are not the "owner" of the
file?  Does it make sense to even call something a "library" when
it can only store <i>disappearing</i> books?  Malware is what makes this
all possible!  Share copies of your eBooks, but do not lend them,
for the only way to implement a lending system is through the use
of access restrictions controlled by <span class="underline">Digital Restrictions
Management</span> (<b>DRM</b>)&#x2013; which is malware, no matter how convenient it
seems.  Lending books <i>physically</i> doesn't require malware&#x2013; only
trust and cooperation.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Wondering why I didn't list any eBook readers that <b>DO</b> respect
your freedom?  Well&#x2026; I haven't listed any, because they don't
exist.  I can't list any right now, but hopefully in the future I'll
be able to.  Currently, the only way to read eBooks in freedom is
through <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/keep-control-of-your-computing.html">a computer that you have full control of</a>.  Can you <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/can-you-trust.html">trust your
PC</a>?  Learn to say <b>NO</b> to <a href="https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/drm.html"><b>DRM</b> or Treacherous Computing</a>!</li>

<h2 id="orgheadline21">Are there any resources available for accessing books online?</h2>
<p>
Yes, but they are hard to come by since most books are copyrighted and
are either distributed with/without a license that restricts the user.
</p>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The main nonfree restriction preventing users from copying and sharing
files, is a clause that says that the owner has exclusive rights to the
<span class="underline">use and distribution</span> of the work; thus, the work is considered
<i>nonfree</i>, because only the owner can <b>freely</b> control what he/she does
with the work&#x2013; <span class="underline">not the users</span>.
</p>

<p>
Due to these problems, it is illegal in most circumstances to release a
free/libre version online that people can share&#x2013; nonfree technical
works, however, <b>CAN</b> be replaced fairly easily with a free/libre
version.  In essence, a book has to either respect your freedom from
the start by including a free/libre license under its Copyright page,
or it needs to be considered public domain material in order for users
to freely use and share it with each other.

<li>Beware of nonfree formats, like Kindle files!</li>

provider takes away control of your files, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.en.html">on their server</a>? <br  /></li>

<b>Postamble:</b> <br  />
If there are any books that exists on the <i>Commandant's Professional
Reading List</i> whose Copyright has expired: Inform me immediately, so that
I can verify whether it can be transcribed or not!  For books that use
nonfree licensing and/or whose Copyrights have not expired, these will
have to be purchased or borrowed from libraries.  For those books, we
will start a lending program and reach out to the <a href="https://www.mca-marines.org/">Marine Corps
Association (MCA)</a> if our libraries are missing them&#x2013; we won't be asking
for Kindles, though.

This is a working document and it is still under development!  If you
would like to contribute useful ideas or suggestions, then E-Mail them to
me so I can review it.  If your ideas abide by the principles set forth
in this book, and improves the professional reading program, chances are
I will include your contribution in the next version of this book!  This
eBook is self-published, and is located in the <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-principles-of-an-ethical-reading-program">Internet Archive</a>.  This
eBook abides by all of the principles set forth within; hopefully, future
eBooks will be the same! <br  />

GNU Free Documentation License <br  />
 Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. <br  />
<br  />
<b>0. PREAMBLE</b> <br  />
</p>

<p>
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
</p>

<p>
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference. <br  />
<br  />
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<b>1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</b> <br  />
</p>

<p>
This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</p>

<p>
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
</p>

<p>
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.
</p>

<p>
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.
</p>

<p>
A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.
</p>

<p>
The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License. <br  />
<br  />
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<b>2. VERBATIM COPYING</b> <br  />
</p>

<p>
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</p>

<p>
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.<br  />
<br  />
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<b>3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</b> <br  />
</p>

<p>
If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</p>

<p>
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document. <br  />
<br  />
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<b>4. MODIFICATIONS</b> <br  />
</p>

<p>
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.</li>

</ol>
</section>
<section>
<ol>
<li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.</li>
<li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.</li>
<li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</li>
<li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.</li>
<li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</li>
<li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.</li>
<li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.</li>

</ol>
</section>
<section>
<ol>
<li>Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.</li>
<li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</li>

</ol>
</section>
<section>
<ol>
<li>For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
and/or dedications given therein.</li>
<li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</li>
<li>Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.</li>
<li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</li>
<li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</li>

</ol>
</section>
<section>
<p>
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</p>

<p>
You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&#x2013;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</p>

<p>
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version. <br  />
<br  />
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<b>5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</b> <br  />
</p>

<p>
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</p>

<p>
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements". <br  />
<br  />
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<b>6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</b> <br  />
</p>

<p>
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.
</p>

<p>
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document. <br  />
<br  />
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<b>7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</b> <br  />
</p>

<p>
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
</p>

<p>
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate. <br  />
<br  />
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<b>8. TRANSLATION</b> <br  />
</p>

<p>
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</p>

<p>
If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title. <br  />
<br  />
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<b>9. TERMINATION</b> <br  />
</p>

<p>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
</p>

<p>
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
</p>

<p>
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it. <br  />
<br  />
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
<b>10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</b> <br  />
</p>

<p>
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
</p>

<p>
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document. <br  />
<br  />
</p>

<p>
<b>11. RELICENSING</b> <br  />
</p>

<p>
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.
</p>

<p>
"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit 
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, 
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license 
published by that same organization.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in 
part, as part of another Document.
</p>

<p>
An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this 
License, and if all works that were first published under this License 
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or 
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and 
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
</p>

<p>
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. <br  />
<br  />

<section>
<p>
<span class="underline"><b>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</b></span> <br  />
</p>

<p>
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
</p>

<p>
Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
Free Documentation License".
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with&#x2026;Texts." line with this:
</p>

<p>
with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
</p>

<p>
If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
</p>

<p>
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
